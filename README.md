# Smart-Parking-System

## Introduction
Now a days in many multiplex systems there is a severe problem for car parking systems .There are many lanes for car parking, so to park a car one has to look for the all lanes. Moreover there is a lot of men labour involved for this process for which there is lot of investment. So the need is to develop a system which indicates directly which lane is vacant.

So the project objective is to develop a system to indicate the vacant lane. The project involves a system including infrared transmitter and receiver in every lane and a led display outside the car parking gate Conventionally, car parking systems does not have any intelligent monitoring system. Parking lots are monitored by human beings. All vehicles enter into the parking and waste time for searching for parking slot. Sometimes it creates blockage. Condition become worse when there are multiple parking lanes and each lane have multiple parking slots. Use of automated system for car parking monitoring will reduce the human efforts. Display unit is installed on entrance of parking lot which will show LEDs for all Parking slot and for all parking lanes. Empty slot is indicated by the respective glowing LED.
